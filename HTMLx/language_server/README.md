# HTMLx Language Server

This folder is reserved for future Language Server Protocol (LSP) support for HTMLx.

## Purpose

A Language Server will provide enhanced IDE integration for HTMLx, including:
- Real-time syntax validation and error reporting
- Code completion and IntelliSense
- Go-to-definition and symbol navigation
- Hover information and documentation
- Refactoring support

## Status

Currently planned but not yet implemented. The core compiler in `markup_v1/` is fully functional and can be used standalone.

## Related Components

- **VS Code Extension**: For full IDE support with real-time validation
- **Standalone Compiler**: Use `htmlx.exe` or `cli.py` for command-line compilation

For more information, see the main [README.md](../README.md).
